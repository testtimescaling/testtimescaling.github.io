Our repository, **Awesome Test-time-Scaling in LLMs**, gathers available papers on test-time scaling, to our current knowledge. Unlike other repositories that categorize papers, we decompose each paper's contributions based on the taxonomy provided by ["What, How, Where, and How Well? A Survey on Test-Time Scaling in Large Language Models"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24235) facilitating easier understand and comparison for readers.

## üìò Introduction
As enthusiasm for scaling computation (data and parameters) in the pertaining era gradually diminished, test-time scaling (TTS)‚Äîalso referred to as ‚Äútest-time computing‚Äù‚Äîhas emerged as a prominent research focus. Recent studies demonstrate that TTS can further elicit the problem-solving capabilities of large language models (LLMs), enabling significant breakthroughs not only in reasoning-intensive tasks, such as mathematics and coding, but also in general tasks like open-ended Q&A. However, despite the explosion of recent efforts in this area, there remains an urgent need for a comprehensive survey offering systemic understanding. To fill this gap, we propose a unified, hierarchical framework structured along four orthogonal dimensions of TTS research: **what to scale**, **how to scale**, **where to scale**, and **how well to scale**.
