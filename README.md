Our repository, **Awesome Test-time-Scaling in LLMs**, gathers available papers on test-time scaling, to our current knowledge. Unlike other repositories that categorize papers, we decompose each paper's contributions based on the taxonomy provided by ["What, How, Where, and How Well? A Survey on Test-Time Scaling in Large Language Models"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24235) facilitating easier understand and comparison for readers.

## üì¢ News and Updates
- **[9/Apr/2025]** üìå Our repository is created.
- **[31/Mar/2025]** üìå Our initial survey is on [**Arxiv**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24235)!

## üìò Introduction
As enthusiasm for scaling computation (data and parameters) in the pertaining era gradually diminished, test-time scaling (TTS)‚Äîalso referred to as ‚Äútest-time computing‚Äù‚Äîhas emerged as a prominent research focus. Recent studies demonstrate that TTS can further elicit the problem-solving capabilities of large language models (LLMs), enabling significant breakthroughs not only in reasoning-intensive tasks, such as mathematics and coding, but also in general tasks like open-ended Q&A. However, despite the explosion of recent efforts in this area, there remains an urgent need for a comprehensive survey offering systemic understanding. To fill this gap, we propose a unified, hierarchical framework structured along four orthogonal dimensions of TTS research: **what to scale**, **how to scale**, **where to scale**, and **how well to scale**. Building upon this taxonomy, we conduct a holistic review of methods, application scenarios, and assessment aspects, and present an organized decomposition that highlights the unique contributions of individual methods within the broader TTS landscape.

## üß¨ Taxonomy

### 1. **What to Scale**
``What to scale'' refers to the specific form of TTS that is expanded or adjusted to enhance an LLM‚Äôs performance during inference.
- **Parallel Scaling** improves test-time performance by generating multiple outputs in parallel and then aggregating them into a final answer.
- **Sequential Scaling** involves explicitly directing later computations based on intermediate steps.
- **Hybrid Scaling** exploits the complementary benefits of parallel and sequential scaling.
- **Internal Scaling** elicits a model to autonomously determine how much computation to allocate for reasoning during testing within the model‚Äôs internal parameters, instead of external human-guided strategies.

### 2. **How to Scale**
- **Tuning**
  - Supervised Fine-Tuning (_SFT_): by training on synthetic or distilled long CoT examples, SFT allows a model to imitate extended reasoning patterns.
  - Reinforcement Learning (_RL_): RL can guide a model‚Äôs policy to generate longer or more accurate solutions.
- **Inference**
  - Stimulation (_STI_): It basically stimulates the LLM to generate more and longer samples instead of generating individual samples directly.
  - Verification (_VER_): The verification process plays an important role in the TTS, and it can be adapted to: i) directly selects the output sample among various ones, under the Parallel Scaling paradigm; ii) guides the stimulation process and determines when to stop, under the Sequential Scaling paradigm; iii) serves as the criteria in the search process; iv) determines what sample to aggregate and how to aggregate them, e.g., weights.
  - Search (_SEA_): Search is a time-tested technique for retrieving relevant information from large databases, and it can also systematically explore the potential outputs of LLMs to improve complex reasoning tasks.
  - Aggregation (_AGG_): Aggregation techniques consolidate multiple solutions into a final decision to enhance the reliability and robustness of model predictions at test time.

### 3. **Where to Scale**
- **Reasoning**: Math, Code, Science, Game & Strategy, Medical and so on.
- **General-Purpose**: Basics, Agents,  Knowledge, Open-Ended, Multi-Modal and so on.

### 4. **How Well to Scale**
- **Performance**: This dimension measures the correctness and robustness of outputs.
- **Efficiency**: it captures the cost-benefit tradeoffs of TTS methods.
- **Controllability**: This dimension assesses whether TTS methods adhere to resource or output constraints, such as compute budgets or output lengths.
- **Scalability**: Scalability quantifies how well models improve with more test-time compute (e.g., tokens or steps).
